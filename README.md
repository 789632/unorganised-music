# Unorganised Music

The tools used to make and perform Unorganised Music.

I still mean to convert the tasks to patterns, but here it is for now.

BASICALLY there are two streams of samples to select from. Each stream loops through the selected samples at a rate of your choosing. The samples are triggered by one clock, seperate from the sample loop clock - due to the differing rate of sample selection and triggering, some nice patterns emerge with very little work.

You can drop a folder of samples into the little 'drop folder' bit for your own music. Be warned - samples play in their entirety.

There are controls for panning the streams (with 'stereo' and 'mono' presets), 'stopping' the loop so that the same samples are held, a kick and clap for four-to-the-floor action (these don't work too well and I hate them), and weird controls to set the sample trigger amount followed by a silent amount (that doesn't make sense, but play with the numbers and you'll see).
